Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Answer: "Child called" will be printed out b/c a instance of the Child class has been created. In this case, when
a instance of the Child class is created its default constructor will have "Child called" printed out.



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
