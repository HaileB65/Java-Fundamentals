2) Once complete, practice the following on your own machine and paste the commands you run for each step below.

Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice. Command: mkdir git_practice
    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder. Command: git init

        c. Add file. Command: git add file1.txt
        d. Commit file. Command: git commit -m "adding file1.txt"
        c. On Github, create new git_practice repository
        d. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>. Command: git remote haile https://github.com/HaileB65/Java-Fundamentals
        d. Push commit file to Github. Command: git push haile master
        e. Practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:
            i.   Create or modify file

        (directions are provided on Github with new repo is created). Command: git remote haile2 https://github.com/HaileB65/git_practice_2
    3. Push local git repository to your Github using the new remote. Command: git push haile2 master

Cloning repository from Github
    1. Find a repository on Github
    2. Clone repository to local machine Command: git clone https://github.com/codingnomads/online-java-fundamentals.git
    3. Create new repository on Github
    4. Add new remote on local machine Command: git remote haile https://github.com/HaileB65/Java-Fundamentals
    5. Push to new Github repository Command: git push haile master
